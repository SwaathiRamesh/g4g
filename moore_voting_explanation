How does Moore's algorith work ?

The Moore's algorithm finds the majority element in an array. A majority element is one that occurs more than n/2 of the times.
For instance, consider this array of 12 elements:
		5, 1, 5, 5, 3, 5, 90, 88, 5, 5, 5, 34

In the best case of arrangement of elements, they get repeated and we can find this out by checking the successive elements.

However, there is no way of finding if the number of occurences is at least n/2. This is the issue that Moore takes care of.
The algo keeps track of the candidate for the majority element and the votes for it.
When the number of votes drops to zero, the element currently in the iteration is made the candidate element. 
This continues till we reach the end of array.

Proof of correctness:
	This is cutting out for every element a corresponding non equal element.
	When such a pairing occurs, as the majority element occurs at least n/2+1 times, at least one pair will have a repeated element.
	This is what the vote keeps track of.
